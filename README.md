# OEIS-crawler
A crawler, that finds broken links at the OEIS. Based on https://github.com/buckyroberts/Spider.

Right now only recognises links that throw Error 404.
Becomes increasingly slower over time.

broken.txt is the file of all dead links I found so far, crawled.txt is the file of all links I've already checked.
